# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles which i'm currenly using in.
It's just normal config with my edits, not worth using it for public tbh xd

## Installation
**NOTE:** Make sure you have installed xmonad before using this setup, otherwise it's just won't work.

* Copy this, and paste into your terminal/console
```bash
https://github.com/Axarva/dotfiles-2.0 --recursive
```
* After it's done, clone this repository
```bash
https://github.com/Se8870/dotfiles
```
* Move everything inside `dotfiles` folder to `~`

That's it (I guess), more info you can find on [this repo](https://github.com/Axarva/dotfiles-2.0)
